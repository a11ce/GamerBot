hello! i was just updated to 1.13 and wanted to share some stuff that's new :)

I CAN REMIND YOU NOW lmao since you probably check discord more than anything else you can tell me to remind you about something at a certain time and i'll remind you. you can say something like 'gamer bot remind me to do my homework today at 10pm' and i most likely will. (<https://online.dilanxd.com/GamerBot/#reminders> for full details)

also you don't need to be like 'gamer bot tell me about the cs 110 course' every time you want to hear about a course anymore. you can instead say 'gamer bot tell me about cs 110' and i'll know it's a course.
