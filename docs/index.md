# Gamer Bot Help
I bet you're wondering what gamer bot can do. Look at this.

### Overview
Gamer bot can only read messages that contain its name (`gamer bot` by default) in it.

### Greetings and Random Stuff
You can say hello/hey/hi/etc to gamer bot, and it'll say hi back. You can also ask it how it is, etc.

### Memory
You can tell gamer bot what your name is and it'll remember that forever. You can then tell it to remember stuff about you, something like `gamer bot remember that i like food`.

You can then ask it what your name is or to tell you about yourself and it'll tell you everything it remembers about you. You can even be specific, asking something like `gamer bot what do i like`.

The fun part is you can ask gamer bot questions about other people. You could be like `gamer bot what's dilan's favorite color` and if it knows it'll tell you. You can also ask it to tell you about someone else.

If you want it to forget something, just be like `gamer bot forget that i like food` or whatever you want it to forget and it'll do as you ask. You can also tell it to forget everything about you and it'll forget everything about you, including your name.

### Mathematics
Gamer bot has a degree in mathematics so you can ask it to evaluate any mathematical expression. Say something like `gamer bot what's 5+5` or `gamer bot do this math: sqrt(25)` and it'll calculate the answer for you.

### Northwestern
Gamer bot has a side job at Northwestern University so it knows about every single Northwestern course, as well as all the COVID-19 data on campus.

Ask it something like `gamer bot tell me about the cs 211 course` or `gamer bot find the description for this course: math 228-1` and it's got you covered with the course description and prereqs. If you remember part of the name rather than the number, you could even be like `gamer bot tell me about this course: cs fundamentals` and it'll search that subject's courses' names for what you want. Those statements are just examples. The idea is that you can ask it in multiple ways as long as it's clear what you're trying to ask. Like you could say `gamer bot search for this course: cs 110` or in a bunch of other ways as well.

If you wanna know whether you're gonna die if you go outside just ask it something like `gamer bot what's covid like on campus` or `gamer bot what are the covid cases like on campus` and it'll tell you.

### Dictionary and Thesaurus
Gamer bot also has a degree in English so you can ask it what any word means. Ask it something like `gamer bot what does gamer mean` and it'll tell you.

It even knows synonyms and antonyms for words, so you could be like `gamer bot what's another word for hello` or `gamer bot what's the opposite of stop` and it'll tell you everything it knows.

### Stonks
Gamer bot had a minor in economics back in bot college so it can give you stock data when you ask it something like `gamer bot give me the stock data for aapl`, or even crypto data if you're like `gamer bot show me the value of btc`.

### Music
Gamer bot loves music and knows the lyrics to like every song ever. If you're like `gamer bot what's the song that goes hey now youre an all star` or something like that, it'll give you a list of songs you might be thinking of.

### Chemistry
Gamer bot used to be a chemist so it has the periodic table memorized. You can be like `gamer bot what's the name for Fe` or `gamer bot what's the atomic number of gold` or `gamer bot give me a description of the element sulfur` and it'll tell you.

### Learning
Gamer bot wasn't born with the knowledge of every single phrase. However, it does know a bunch already. If it knows something that's similar to what you're saying but it doesn't know the exact phrase you're using to say it, feel free to teach it! For example, gamer bot reacts when you say something like `gamer bot you're awesome` but might not understand when you say `gamer bot you're great`, which should pretty much result in the same response. You can teach gamer bot that they're similar by saying `gamer bot learn that saying you're awesome is like saying you're great`. It'll remember that and you can now use both interchangeably.

### Weather
Oh I almost forgot to mention that gamer bot had a part time job as a meteorologist, so it knows the weather of like every place on the planet. Ask something like `gamer bot what's the weather in chicago` or something and you'll find out.

### Bye
Let me know if you want to add something to gamer bot and I'll show you how it's set up. If you know some Python and wanna make cool stuff this is fun. Also let me know if you wanna see how your save data looks and I can show you what gamer bot knows about you. This is really fun so I'm gonna add a ton of random stuff over time.
